# Training MoCoV2 on CIFAR10 Dataset

Here are some notebooks and scripts to train MoCoV2 on CIFAR10 (and easily adjustible for other datasets).

Soon I will make this readme better with more info on how to tune this model yourself, and add scripts so you dont have to do it through a jupyter notebook.

# Notes
- MoCoV2 implementation was made by taking the MoCoV1 implementation from [lightly](https://docs.lightly.ai/tutorials/package/tutorial_moco_memory_bank.html) and making some tweaks.
