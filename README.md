# Training MoCoV2 on CIFAR10 Dataset

Here are some notebooks and scripts to train MoCoV2 on CIFAR10 (and easily adjustible for other datasets).

Soon I will make this readme better with more info on how to tune this model yourself, and add scripts so you dont have to do it through a jupyter notebook.

# Instructions
- Download CIFAR10 in folders from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/swaroopkml/cifar10-pngs-in-folders

# Results
- @TODO

# Notes
- MoCoV2 implementation was made by taking the MoCoV1 implementation from [lightly](https://docs.lightly.ai/tutorials/package/tutorial_moco_memory_bank.html) and making some tweaks.
- Original MoCo paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722
- MoCoV2 paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04297
- CIFAR10 website: https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/

# @TODO
## Code
- figure out why histograms dont work in moco_model.py
## Other stuff
- Add results (graphs and stuff)
- Describe files/classes/functions
